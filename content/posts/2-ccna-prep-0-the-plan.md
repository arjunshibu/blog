I'm preparing for CCNA as part of switching role from software engineering to security. The resources I use for learning are:

1. [Jeremy's IT Lab](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxbwE86jKRgMpuZuLBivzlM8s2Dk5lXBQ&si=053pO8VQmFxBf6OZ)
2. [Anki Flashcards](https://youtu.be/6Atw8oMtVTA?si=a0CYgC_6pvwI2aX0)

The plan is simple. I watch Jeremy's videos and summarize it using AI and post it here. This will be helpful for me if I need a quick refresh (an obvious lie, my memory is just too bad) of the stuff I learned.

Hugs and kisses if you found this prep series useful.
