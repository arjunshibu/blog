My name is Arjun Shibu, an infosec hobbyist and bug hunter from Kerala, India, living in Thodupuzha. This blog is for documentation about my infosec journey, web, mobile and open-source security, bug bounty, exploit development and ctf solutions. I love to learn new things every day related to security and development.

I'm currently looking for new opportunities, my inbox is always open. Whether you have any question or just wants to say hi, I'll try my best to get back to you!
